/* Why hashing? A way of converting arbitrary data into a fixed size number
 * For secure communication, it provides a way to check that the data hasn't been changed
 * What do we need?
 * struct node: node for storing an item in a binary tree
 * struct bst: for storing a binary tree at each index of hash tree
 * struct bst *arr
